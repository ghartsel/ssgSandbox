# ssgSandbox
Sandbox for exploring static site generators and for single-source authoring.

Content coming soon. The idea is to single-source ODF-formatted content that will be used to generate the Markdown and ReStructuredText for each of the static site generators. The output will be hosted on Netlify, Readthedocs, and GitHub Pages.
